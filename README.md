# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

  The major obstacle to developing the perfect solution for a customer is in properly interpreting their needs. In a traditional environment a sales team may work directly with a representative of the customer, who will order something based on their perceived need. This would then get translated through multiple departments before something is built. Since the process is disjointed, the chance of producing something that the customer did not truly want, or does not fit their needs as well as it could, is higher. 
  Therefore, creating user stories helps by distilling customer requirements into exact usage statements. I need X in order to perform Y. By using a set of these statements, a piece of software instead can be crafted exactly to the customers requirements.
  
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  One of the main tenets of the agile software development process is producing a program in small increments. Features are added a little at a time, and at the end of each incremental build, can be reviewed and the directions adjusted. I think this is a great process to include in any development work. It fits especially with computer programming, where you would typically want to build a program piece by piece in order to properly test each part and not be overwhelmed writing large unwieldy "chunks" instead.
  Also, a test driven development methodology will work especially well here, as it reinforces the effort to build towards what the end user requires. By building software to match predetermined test cases, you ensure that software is built to a working standard innately and that the software will do only what is required (no less, no more, this is the most efficient path especially for prototyping).
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  The main quality of a good teammate would be a great communication. Working in a team is all about being able to efficiently and effectively coordinate effort, and open communication is the only way to achieve this. Another trait of a good team member is being able and willing to support other members of the group. There may be times when you need help, or, times when you are ahead and others can use help. By this process the entire team will benefit with a more steady and efficient workflow.
